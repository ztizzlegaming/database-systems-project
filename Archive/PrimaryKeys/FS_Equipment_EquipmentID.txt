                        Currently there is no good primary key in place, so we are defining an
                        artificial primary key for equipment.

NOTES:
The first thought was to use the equipment serial number, but some pieces of
equipment do not have serial numbers, and they can sometimes be changed, so
this was not a good primary key.
