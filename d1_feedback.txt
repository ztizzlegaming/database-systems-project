Team JZ

Hello, everyone!

I hope all is going well as you get started with the project.

All looks good with the team covenant.  It also looks like you've put
a lot of effort into D2.  I will take a look at those as soon as I can
get to them.  Meanwhile, please let me know if you have specific
questions on tables, etc.

Please keep me up-to-date with how things are going for the team as we
go through the project--not just the work, but how well the team is
working together.  Good luck!
