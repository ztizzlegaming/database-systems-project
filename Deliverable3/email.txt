Dear Mr. Holt,

Thank you and Munaf so much for visiting our class and taking the time to present your company’s needs to the class, and for sending the materials to aid in our design of the database. Through the design process, we have found a few things that were not clear to us that we wanted to ask you about.

First, we were unsure of a few of the abbreviations and what they meant. TTD means test tube device, but we were unsure of what “TTD SO Set” and “TTD PS” meant. We were also confused on “Blowdown on 1 time(s)” and “Blowdown on 2 time(s)” and what they meant. Is there a limited number of “Blowdown on” times?

We were confused about how the data would be stored for some of the fields. For pieces of equipment, what kind of data would be stored in equipment updates? We were not sure how this should be stored in the database, depending on what kind of data should be stored here. Also, for equipment shelf location, should this have a specific form, like shelf number, aisle number, etc. or should it just be a text field that an admin could type into? Finally, we were also confused on the modifications to equipment and how they should be represented. Is there a list of specific modifications that can be done to equipment?

Finally, in pressure drop specifications, there are fields for four zones. Are there always exactly four zones? Is there a possibility of having more than four zones in the future?

Here is the mission statement and mission objectives that we have developed:
The purpose of the TubeMaster database is to maintain logistical data necessary to successfully perform jobs requested by clients in the catalyst industry.
- Keep track of client information
- Maintain reactor logistics
- Maintain accurate equipment availability data.
- Maintain up-to-date assembly composition information.
- Track the modification information of equipment.

Also, attached is our list of tables and fields of the database.

Again, thank you all so much for the presentation and the material you have supplied to us.

Best,
Jordan, Jenna, James, and Zeyang
