TEAM COVENANT

INSTRUCTIONS:

Please meet in person as a team.  It is especially important that each
member be present for the initial meeting.  Discuss a strategy for
working on the project.  In the first phase, you will design the
database together.  The second phase is implementation (SQL, PHP, and
HTML).  You will likely need to adjust your strategy as you move from
the first phase to the second.  You may also need to modify this
covenant due to unforeseen changes in team members schedules.

One of you should create a project for your team on our GitLab
(code.centre.edu).  Call it csc410-labs-[YOUR LAST NAME].  This
project should be different from your labs.  (See instructions for
Lab01.)  As usual, add me as a "Master".  This time also add all other
members of the team.  You can edit this covenant on one computer and
then commit it to git, or each of you can modify it.

Decide on a regular meeting time and place--at least one regular
meeting per week.  Come to a consensus on when and where.  Be
realistic.  If you cannot be present, or if a location would not work
well for you, discuss this openly as a team.  Also consider the
schedule for the term project and how it relates to your other
commitments (classes, sports, clubs, religious activities, etc.)  If
there will be points during the semester when it will be difficult or
impossible for you to contribute to the project, you should discuss
this as a team.  For example, you may want to decide now that you will
need to submit a particular deliverable early.

If you make changes to this covenant, all team members should come to
agreement.  Then commit the revised covenant via git.

AGREED MEETING TIME/PLACE FOR REGULAR WEEKLY TEAM MEETINGS/WORK:
Wedenesday 7pm @ Olin 023




OUR PLAN FOR SUBMITTING THE DELIVERABLES:

[Note: The deadlines are listed below, and it is OK to leave these
unchanged.  However, your team may need to submit one or more
deliverables early due to your team members' constraints and other
commitments.  Of course, you could also choose as a team to submit a
deliverable late--but keep in mind that this will result in a reduced
score of 10 points (out of 100) per day or part of a day late.  The
reason for the penalty is to help teams stay on track and have greater
success in completing the project as a whole.]
